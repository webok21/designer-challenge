                <p>
                    Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills
                    and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                    only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that
                    makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
                    daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
                    something nice and did not solve any problem.
